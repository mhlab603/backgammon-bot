# mhlab Backgammon Bot

I build this bot over winter break to learn more about how C++ works as a programming language, as well as to gain experience writing applications.

I chose C++ as I wanted to learn more about how to use C++'s advanced features, as well as creating/managing a CMake project by myself.
